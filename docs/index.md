# UBCSailbot Software Team Docs

Welcome to the UBC Sailbot software team docs :wave:

## :fontawesome-solid-circle-info: What information is on this website?

Information on our current project is contained on this website. In particular, information on each of our major software
projects are provided in detail.

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Current Project Overview](./current/overview.md){target=_blank}

References to the software tools that we use are also provided on this website. This includes basic information on these
tools, how we use these tools on UBC Sailbot, and external links to helpful references and tutorials.

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Software Team References](./reference/cpp/start.md){target=_blank}

## :octicons-people-24: Who is this website for?

The docs site is primarily for the members on the UBC Sailbot software team. However, curious members of the public and/or
those who are interested in contributing to our open source software would also benefit from this site.

## :logo: How was this website created?

We use [:logo: Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){target=_blank}, an open source software
that allows developers to create fast and lightweight websites simply using [markdown](./reference/markdown.md){target=_blank}.
This enables the software team to quickly create documentation and put it on a professional website without requiring our
team members to possess extensive web development knowledge.
