# Getting Started

We use Python 3 to write the majority of our software at UBC Sailbot. Therefore, it is critical that you get familiar
with the language and be able to use it to get your assigned tasks completed.

## Installation

There are two main options when you want to install python. Each has its own benefits.

!!! note

    You may not need to install python directly on your machine. The installation instructions below are
    merely here to help you in case you need to. Ask your lead if you need to install python.

### Installing python directly

You can install python directly by following the installation instructions on [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

The only drawback of installing python directly on your machine is that upgrading/downgrading is more tedious to
do if you ever need to.

### Installing anaconda

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is a python and R distribution that aims to provide everything that you would
need for data science. This includes:

- The Python and R languages
- Python and R libraries
- Common IDEs like VSCode, PyCharm, Jupyter, Spyder, etc.
- The `conda` package manager used for updating Anaconda packages

This is not a standard tool used across Sailbot, but it is an option that is available to you. The main benefit of
using Anaconda over installing python directly is that you can leverage virtual environments to change both your
dependencies and your python version very quickly and effortlessly. The main drawback of using Anaconda is that it
is clunky and can take up a fair amount of memory on your machine. Furthermore, you are also relying on a company
for a major tool that you use (which can also be seen as a disadvantage depending on your preferences).

## Python tutorials

We understand that not everyone who joins Sailbot has Python in their toolkit, nor do we expect it either! Whether you
are learning Python for the first time or you just want to brush up, we have provided some resources below. You **will not**
learn absolutely everything from the resources below, but it is a good starting point. You will mostly learn through doing,
as you would with most technical skills!

| Resource               | Description                                                                                    |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) | The official python tutorial. Good if you have some time on your hands and you are a completionist. Sections 1 - 5 and 9 are the most relevant. |
| [w3schools Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) | Good if you want a more brief introduction to Python. It breaks down a lot of concepts into sections. Everything up to Python Classes/Objects is relevant. |
| [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/t8pPdKYpowI) | If you like video tutorials, then we recommend this tutorial. This video is about 5 hours long, but it pretty much covers everything that you'll need to know for Python and there are some hands on  projects. |
| [Shorter YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/kqtD5dpn9C8) | A shorter alternative YouTube tutorial condensed into 1 hour. It covers less material but still covers many of the essentials. |
| [CodingBat Practice](https://codingbat.com/python) | Good resource to put your Python skills to practice on some simple coding problems. Note that this resource does not teach you python. |

Feel free to use other resources other than the ones listed above if you find any that you like!
