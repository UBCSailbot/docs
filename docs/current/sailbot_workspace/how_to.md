# How-To's

## Containerized applications

!!! info ""

    New in [:octicons-tag-24: v1.1.0](https://github.com/UBCSailbot/sailbot_workspace/releases/tag/v1.1.0){target=_blank}

We have containerized the following applications for a variety of reasons:

- [MongoDB database](https://www.mongodb.com/){target=_blank}
- [Docs site](https://github.com/UBCSailbot/docs){target=_blank}
- [Website](https://github.com/UBCSailbot/website){target=_blank}

### Running containerized applications

In the first section of `dockerComposeFile` of `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, there is a list of files:
each file contains the configuration for one or more applications.

The ones that are commented out are not run. To run them:

1. Uncomment the Docker Compose file(s) that the application(s) you desire to run are defined in
    - Programs that are defined in the uncommented Docker Compose files will be started and stopped with Sailbot Workspace
2. Run the `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container` VS Code command to restart Sailbot Workspace

To stop running them:

1. Comment out the corresponding Docker Compose file
2. Stop the application's container: see [Managing containerized applications](#managing-containerized-applications)

### Viewing MongoDB data

Connect the [MongoDB VS Code extension](https://www.mongodb.com/products/vs-code){target=_blank} to the running database:
[Create a Connection for Deployment](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-vscode/connect/#create-a-connection-to-a-deployment){target=_blank}

- Use the default methods: "Paste Connection String" and "Open from Overview Page"
- Our database's connection string is `mongodb://localhost:27017`
- See the [MongoDB VS Code extension docs](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-vscode/){target=_blank} for how
  to use it to navigate or explore the database

### Opening Docs or Website

Docs runs on port 8000 and Website 3005. You can see them in your browser at `localhost:<port>`. To open them using VS Code:

1. Run the `Ports: Focus on Ports View` VS Code command
2. Open the site by hovering over its local address and clicking either "Open in Browser" or "Preview in Editor"
    - The local address of Docs is the line with a port of 8000
    - The local address of Website is the line with a port of 3005

!!! tip "Turn off auto saving"

    Changes made to their files are loaded when they are saved, so **if Auto Save is on, turn it off**
    so that the Docs/Website servers aren't continuously reloading. Auto Save is on by default in GitHub Codespaces

### Managing containerized applications

Each application runs in a Docker container. Containers can be managed using Docker Desktop or CLI commands:

- View Sailbot Workspace containers

    === ":material-docker: Docker Desktop"

        1. Select "Containers" in the top right
        2. Expand "sailbot_workspace_devcontainer"
            - The "Status" column shows whether a container is running or not

    === ":octicons-terminal-24: CLI Commands"

        ```
        docker ps -a
        ```

        - Sailbot Workspace containers should be named something like `sailbot_workspace_devcontainer-<application>-<number>`
        - The `STATUS` column shows whether a container is running or not

- View a container's logs, the output of the container (including errors that caused it to stop)

    === ":material-docker: Docker Desktop"

        1. Click on a container
        2. Navigate to the "Logs" view if not already on it

    === ":octicons-terminal-24: CLI Commands"

        ```
        docker logs <container>
        ```

- Start a container that is not running

    === ":material-docker: Docker Desktop"

        1. Click start :material-play:

    === ":octicons-terminal-24: CLI Commands"

        ```
        docker start <container>
        ```

- Stop a container that is running

    === ":material-docker: Docker Desktop"

        1. Click stop :material-stop:

    === ":octicons-terminal-24: CLI Commands"

        ```
        docker stop <container>
        ```

## Temporarily add apt packages

If a task requires you to add apt packages, you can quickly test them in your Dev Container:

1. Uncomment the section in `Dockerfile` that installs additional packages
2. Add the desired packages below the line `# Your package list here` with the format:

    ```sh
    # Your package list here
    _pkg1_ \
    _pkg2_ \
    ```

3. Run the `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container` VS Code command

Before merging in the PR, you should migrate the apt package installations to a more permanent location in upstream
[images](./docker_images.md){target=_blank}: `base`, `local-base`, `dev`, or `pre-base`.

## Use your dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files for various programs.[^1]

??? info "More about dotfiles"

    - They are called dotfiles because their filenames start with a dot (`.`)
    - On Linux and MacOS, files and directories that begin with a dot are hidden by default
    - To list dotfiles using the `ls` command, specify the `-a` argument: `ls -a`

Dotfiles that are commonly modified include:

- Bash: `~/.bashrc`
- Git: `~/.gitconfig`
- Vim: `~/.vimrc`

To use your dotfiles:

1. Ensure that the `base`, `local-base`, or `dev` [image](./docker_images.md){target=_blank}
   installs the programs that the dotfiles correspond to
2. Copy the dotfiles to the `.devcontainer/config/` directory.
   If a dotfile is located in a child directory, you will have to created it.
   For example, if a dotfile's path is `~/.config/ex_dotfile`, you will need to copy it to `.devcontainer/config/.config/ex_dotfile`

    !!! warning "Special cases"

        - `~/.gitconfig`: there is no need copy your Git dotfile, as Dev Containers do this automatically
        - `~/.bashrc`: don't copy your Bash dotfile, as it would override the one created in the `dev` image.
        Instead, add your bash configuration `.aliases.bash` or `.functions.bash` in the config directory, as these are sourced
        by the created Bash dotfile.

3. Run the `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container` VS Code command

[^1]: [Dotfiles â€“ What is a Dotfile and How to Create it in Mac and Linux](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dotfiles-what-is-a-dot-file-and-how-to-create-it-in-mac-and-linux/){target=_blank}

## Run Raye's software

Raye was our previous project. Her software can be run in the `raye` branch:

1. Switch to the `raye` branch: `git switch raye`
2. Rebuild the Dev Container: run the `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container` VS Code command

!!! warning "`raye` branch disclaimers"

    1. Since `raye` (and Raye's codebase in general) is not in active development, it may not be 100% functional
       or contain all the features in `main`
    2. `raye` is more memory intensive than `main` because the parent image of its Dev Container is much larger;
       this may lead to worse performance

### Build Raye's ROS packages

To build Raye's ROS packages, run the following commands:

```bash
roscd
catkin_make
```

### Run packages from different workspaces

The `raye` branch has two ROS workspaces: one for Raye and one for the new project.
To run ROS packages, you will have to source the overlay of the workspace that it is in:

=== "New Project"

    ```
    srcnew
    ```

=== "Raye"

    ```
    srcraye
    ```

Then you can run launch files or package-specific executables in that workspace with:

=== "New Project"

    `ros2 launch ...` or `ros2 run ...`, respectively.

=== "Raye"

    `roslaunch ...` or `rosrun ...`, respectively.

### Raye's known issues

!!! bug "Run commands for Raye packages are very slow"

    On non-Ubuntu-based Linux operating systems, Run commands for Raye packages may take a long time to start-up.
    This is because the system has trouble resolving the local hostname.

    To resolve this bug, run the commands below in the Dev Container:

    ```bash
    echo 'export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
